 Subject:
  Do rising CO2 emissions in the United States have a relation the quantity of natural disasters and the rise of Financial Impact of these disasters.

Purpose:  
  For our project, we would  like to compare the rise in CO2 emissions with the yearly financial impact of natural disasters.  Is there a correlation, and if so what predictions     can we make about the current year, 5, 10, and 15 years in the future?

Scope:
  Flooding, wildfires, drought, hurricane, tornado, landslide, are the natural disasters that we plan on basing our data sets as well as man made disasters.  Currently we have       eliminated earthquakes, but will need to revisit this once we begin to gather data.    

Footprint:
  We would like to discuss this with Tom S. in Tuesday's class. The current image is that we would examine the United States of America, but we are unsure if this would be too       much data for the amount of time we have for analysis.

Our Hypothesis -
  The United States total emissions will create a rise in natural disasters. This then will also create a rise in the financial tol the disaster have on the United States. 
  
Our Questions for this project
1.  Was there a rise in CO2 emissions in the United States based on the data we can find and collect?
2.  Was there a rise in natural disasters?
3.  With the data we collected, is there a rise in financial damages from natural disaster
